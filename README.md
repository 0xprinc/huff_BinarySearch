This repository contains the implementation of binary search algorithm using assembly language for Ethereum blockchain. The binary search algorithm is used to search for a specific element in a sorted list or array in an efficient way.

# huff 
This huff code is the implementation of the Binary Search 

binary(uint256 num, uint256[])

# to-do list 
1. Optimising this contract 
2. Writing more test contracts
